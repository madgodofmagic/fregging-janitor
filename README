copy patch to a simplessh 0.2.0.5 checkout and apply it, install that version
come back here and cabal build, then run with:
./dist/build/fregging-janitor/fregging-janitor remote_username command timeout_secs [serverlist_filename]
serverlist is expected to be hostname:[port] for each server in its own line, it will gracefully let you know if it encounters non-integer ports, use a default of 22 if none is supplied, and should ignore any garbage
serverlist_filename can be omitted and the list will be read from stdin, in the same format
timeout applies to tcp handshake for the most part, I don't think it can cancel the thread if execution takes too long
